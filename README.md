Here is archived source code of my first programming project. __Its created on base of another cheat project__.
Its a second version of cheat, first version is lost and third version is in another repo.  
All code leaved in the same state as it was written, except minimal changes done to make it compilable.

## Description
Its second, injectable, version of cheat. First version was autoinjectable by substitution of d3d9.dll  
Here is the functional:  
### Visual
- Wallhack
- Crosshair
- WireFrame
- Night light
### Memory
- Party mob (placing all the mobs into one point in front of the player)
- Freeze Height
- Free camera
- NoClip
- Increasing accuracy
- Manual jump/fall on a certain distance



## Dependencies
To run this code you will need DirectX 9 SDK of June 2010, injector and some app running on DirectX 9. All memhack functions wont run and disabled in code, otherwise app will crash right after inject.  
Config `lib` and `include` folder in solution settings. Run app and inject dll. Menu activates on __Home__ button.
  
# Warning!
Dont use this project in any game, its obsolete and open-sourced. Almost certainly you will be banned.
